# CHEAT SHEETS

Ableton can be hard enough to figure out in itself, let alone trying to remember all of the different key combo‚Äôs. So keep these Cheat Sheets handy, so you can always quickly reference it whenever you need.

Shortcuts might not seem that important, but it can be one of the things that can low-key level up your production. If you actively try to remember to main ones whenever you work, it‚Äôll become second nature in no time, and you‚Äôll be zipping around your project like pro.

Here is the link for the full list of shortcuts from the Ableton Manual:

Notes below & in the future will be written in Mac Shortcuts - Windows more often than not, just uses the equivalent modifier key.

Common document editing shortcuts apply in Ableton as well. Eg:

**‚åò(CMD) / (CTRL) +** **A / C / X / V / D / R / Z** - (Select All, Copy, Cut, Paste, Duplicate, Rename, Undo)

**‚åò(CMD) / (CTRL) +** **‚áß****(SHIFT) + Z** - (Redo)

# Chord Codes

Learning Music theory is like learning a new language, except it makes no sense & it‚Äôs painful for the brain. Thankfully we can use some cheat codes (literally) to get most of the way there!

Even though Ableton now has tools to help you with musical Key Signatures & chords, remembering basic codes likes: 0-4-7 / 0-3-7 or 0-3-5-7-9-11:

Can help with quickly coming up with melodies to work with.

# Emotions & Feels of Musical Key Signitures

Different Key Signatures can initiate certain emotions, and as any creative pursuit things can be subjective, but this is a good place to start if there‚Äôs a direction you‚Äôre looking to aim for.

# Camelot Wheel

DJ‚Äôs should be well versed in using the Camelot wheel, but it can also be very useful for music production as well! If you ever hit a wall / writers block - trying adding some layers using the keys - relative Minor / Major.
