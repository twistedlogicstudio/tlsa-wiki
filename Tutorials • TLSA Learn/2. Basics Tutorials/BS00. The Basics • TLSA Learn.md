# Ableton Basics 

> [!Note]
> The screenshots will be from Ableton Live 12 Suite, but the fundamentals will be the same / similar across Live 11, 10, etc.
> 
> Ongoing lessons will predominantly use Ableton stock plugins - not all are included in the begginer editions of Live - if something is referenced in a lesson that's not included in your edition, reach out and I can help you find some good free alternatives!

# Layout & Functions

Ableton's layout can be seen in 2 main windows.

## 1. Session View

Session View is a non-linear approach to production but is built more towards live performance, being able to launch clips & musical ideas on the fly. This view can be a good way to sketch out ideas or to test out creative ideas for DJ sets.

## 2. Arrangement View

- This is the main view we'll be using throughout the lessons.

Arrangement View is like your standard (linear) time-based editing - same as majority of other DAW's & Video Editing software.

Offers a lot more in editing capabilities compared to Session View.

# Arrangement View â€¢ Layout

> [!Tip] 
> Templates will be provided for you to kickstart things, as well as some Pre-Made beats for you to have a look through.

### Effects / Clip View

The bottom section of Ableton shares both the:
